# Docker-Training
This is the first Docker app for showing my understanding of Dockerization of Applications

This is a basic python app, that shows that using docker we have tow applications that communicate amongst themselves as well the DB. For purposes of this concept flask(web framework) and redis (DB) has been used to show the concept of docker containers interacting with erachother as well as the DB, (application -> application, application -> database).

For this application to run, it is a failry basic application, you have to make use of the following main commands:
Once all the files are downloaded open up the files and use docker-compose build to build the stack, once completed use dockler-compose up to run the application.
This application basically counts the number of time one has opened the web-page in a browser.
